      <p>Edwin Powell Hubble was born on November 20, 1889 in the small town of Marshfield, Missouri. When Edwin was nine years old his family moved to a town close to the city of Chicago, Illinois.  During his high school years Edwin was known to be a good student however was much more accomplished as an athlete, having played baseball, football and basketball.  Edwin also ran track in highschool and during one particular meet, won several first place finishes.</p>
      <p>Edwin enrolled into the University of Chicago and earned a Bachelor's of Science degree apon graduating in 1910.  He also led the University's basketball team to their first conference title in 1907.  During his senior year Edwin applied for the Rhodes scholar and won, him being one of the first students to do so at the University.  This would allow him to be accepted into the prestigious Oxford University in England.</p>
      <p>Edwin spent 3 years at Queen's College, Oxford however did not study science.  In accordance with his fathers wishes, Edwin studied law and would earn a masters degree in jurisprudence.  In 1913 while in England, Edwin's father died.  He moved back to the U.S. that same year to take care of his mother and younger siblings.</p>
      <p>After spending a year half heartedly practicing law, Edwin moved to New Albany, Indiana where he began teaching highschool mathematics, physics, and spanish. He also coached the boy's basketball team.  At the end of the highschool term Edwin decided to pursue his true passion astronomy, and entered graduate school at the University of Chicago.  While studing at the university's yerkees observatory, Edwin had access to one of the world's most powerful telescopes.  He recieved is PhD in 1917.</p>
      <p>That same year, when the United States entered WWI, Edwin joined the U.S. Army.  While tasked with the duties of training new troops, Edwin rose to the rank of Major.  By the time he was sent over to Europe however, the war was winding down and he never saw combat. Edwin would also serve in a civilian role for the U.S. Army during WWII.</p>
      <p>In 1919 Edwin was offered a staff postion at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Mount Wilson observatory near Pasadena, California. He would work as a staff member at the observatory until his death in 1953.  During his time working at the Mount Wilson Observatory, Edwin Hubble is widely credited as being one of first astronomers to discover the existance of other galaxies beyond our own Milkey Way. Hubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence. He is also considered to be the leading astronomer of his time to put forth the idea that our universe is expanding.</p>
